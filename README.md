# Electric Vehicle Market Analysis Project

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market, focusing on the distribution, growth trends, technological advancements, and the impact of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives. The analysis covers both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Tools Used

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench):** Used for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the dataset.
- **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for initial data exploration and creating basic visualizations.
- **Power BI:** Employed to create detailed, interactive dashboards and visualizations for deeper analysis.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

1. **Total Vehicles:** Assessed the overall landscape of EVs, including BEVs and PHEVs, to understand market size and growth trends.
2. **Average Electric Range:** Evaluated the average electric range of EVs to gauge technological progress and efficiency.
3. **Total BEV Vehicles & % of Total BEV Vehicles:** Analyzed the total number of BEVs and calculated their percentage relative to the total EV market.
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles & % of Total PHEV Vehicles:** Analyzed the total number of PHEVs and their market share within the overall EV landscape.
